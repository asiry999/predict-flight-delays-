Project Proposal
How do we predict flight delays at take-off?
in this notebook, I develop a model aimed at predicting flight delays at take-off. The purpose is not to obtain the best possible prediction but rather to emphasize on the various steps needed to build such a model. Along this path, I then put in evidence some basic but important concepts. Among then, I comment on the importance of the separation of the dataset during the traning stage and how cross-validation helps in determing accurate model parameters. I show how to build linear and polynomial models for univariate or multivariate regressions and also, I give some insight on the reason why regularisation helps us in developing models that generalize well.
Dataset:
In the study of predicting flight delays, we used a dataset on Kaggle.
The dataset is available as the .csv file.
The dataset is available as the .csv file. a sample of data is shown in the following table:
 

Tools:
There are tools that will be used to achieve the goal of this study, such as: 
TensorFlow
 matplotlib
pandas
nltk 

TO DO:
Explore the data and come up with EDA phases then use a model to fit the data.
NOTE: the used features may be increased or changed and the model as well
